# Unity animation to VMD

I'm just trying to convert Mecanim Unity animations
to VMD here.

The project is currenlty barely working, with bones
rotations being pretty messed up, and nothing else
is exported.

Don't expect anything yet.

Also, the Scene might not be useable currently,
since I'm using models that I cannot share here.  
Since MMD models are kind-of required here, using
shareable models will be pretty difficult.
